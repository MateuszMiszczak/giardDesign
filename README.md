Guidelines:
1. The project should utilize Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS (It's constructed using Tailwind CSS).
2. It must be responsive on tablets and mobile devices (Responsiveness has been implemented for all screen widths below 1440px).
3. In addition to ensuring precise representation, the project should incorporate dynamic elements, including engaging animations (Few animations have been incorporated).
4. The utilization of React or any other frontend framework is not allowed. The rationale is straightforward: To showcase one's ability to write in vanilla JS.
